                <div class="content mt-4"><p>Our mission is to drive adoption of an open-source mobile ecosystem, where different mobile hardware OEMs, Content Partners and apps developers could have access to non-restricted tools, which they do not have today, to deliver high quality mobile experiences.</p>

<p><img src="/images/main/OMH_logo.jpg" alt="About" /></p>

<h1 id="current-experience-in-the-android-mobile-ecosystems">Current Experience in the Android Mobile Ecosystems</h1>

<p>Google Mobile Services (GMS) are an integral part of most of the Android mobile devices, offering features like Google Maps, Login/Authentication, Google Drive, and many more. These features are core to the seamless user experience across most of the Android Applications.
Mobile devices who don’t have GMS core services, experience a limited user experience as these services are not present, resulting in apps failing to run properly.
An Open Mobile Ecosystem seeks to offer a seamless experience where different mobile hardware OEMs, Content Partners and apps developers could have access to non-restricted tools and services, which they do not have today, to deliver high quality mobile experiences, for both GMS and non-GMS devices.
The Open Mobile Hub (OMH) client SDK is an open-source framework designed to address these limitations.</p>

<h1 id="omh-architecture">OMH Architecture</h1>

<ul>
  <li>The OMH SDKs are open-source and available in GitHub.</li>
  <li>App Developers can add the OMH SDK to their app, as part of a single build to support both GMS and non-GMS devices at run-time, or can chose to have separate builds. This is managed through a standard API.
    <ul>
      <li>If the device running OMH is a GMS device, OMH will act as a pass-through to allow for all the GMS SDKs to work seamlessly.</li>
      <li>If the device running OMH is a non-GMS device, OMH will leverage alternative implementations like Google public Web APIs, Third-Party, or custom implementations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Providers can write implementations or OMH plugins of the APIs, and surface services to the apps.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="enhancing-qualitative-characteristics">Enhancing Qualitative Characteristics</h2>

<h3 id="verifiability">Verifiability</h3>

<p>Verifiability implies consensus between the different knowledgeable and independent users of financial information. Such information must be supported by sufficient evidence to follow the principle of objectivity.</p>

<h3 id="comparability">Comparability</h3>

<p>Comparability is the uniform application of accounting methods across entities in the same industry. The principle of consistency is under comparability. Consistency is the uniform application of accounting across points in time within an entity.</p>

<h3 id="understandability">Understandability</h3>

<p>Understandability means that accounting reports should be expressed as clearly as possible and should be understood by those to whom the information is relevant.
Timeliness: Timeliness implies that financial information must be presented to the users before a decision is to be made.</p>

<h2 id="statement-of-cash-flows">Statement of cash flows</h2>

<p>The statement of cash flows considers the inputs and outputs in concrete cash within a stated period. The general template of a cash flow statement is as follows: Cash Inflow - Cash Outflow + Opening Balance = Closing Balance</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Cash Inflow</th>
      <th>Outflow</th>
      <th>Opening Balance</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Monday</em></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tuesday</code></td>
      <td><strong>Wednesday</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> in the beginning of September, Ellen started out with $5 in her bank account. During that same month, Ellen borrowed $20 from Tom. At the end of the month, Ellen bought a pair of shoes for $7. Ellen’s cash flow statement for the month of September looks like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cash inflow: $20</li>
  <li>Cash outflow:$7</li>
  <li>Opening balance: $5</li>
  <li>Closing balance: $20 – $7 + $5 = $18</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> in the beginning of June, WikiTables, a company that buys and resells tables, sold 2 tables. They’d originally bought the tables for $25 each, and sold them at a price of $50 per table. The first table was paid out in cash however the second one was bought in credit terms. WikiTables’ cash flow statement for the month of June looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Important:</strong> the cash flow statement only considers the exchange of actual cash, and ignores what the person in question owes or is owed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="statement-of-financial-position-balance-sheet">Statement of financial position (balance sheet)</h2>

<p>The balance sheet is the financial statement showing a firm’s assets, liabilities and equity (capital) at a set point in time, usually the end of the fiscal year reported on the accompanying income statement.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>fixed assets</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>property</li>
      <li>building</li>
      <li>equipment (such as factory machinery)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>intangible assets</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>copyrights</li>
      <li>trademarks</li>
      <li>patents
        <ul>
          <li>pending</li>
          <li>international</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>goodwill</li>
</ul>

<p>Owner’s equity, sometimes referred to as net assets, is represented differently depending on the type of business ownership. Business ownership can be in the form of a sole proprietorship, partnership, or a corporation. For a corporation, the owner’s equity portion usually shows common stock, and retained earnings (earnings kept in the company). Retained earnings come from the retained earnings statement, prepared prior to the balance sheet.</p>
