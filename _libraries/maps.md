<h1>A single codebase, running seamlessly on any device</h1>

OMH Maps Client Library is a client SDK that simplifies the integration of maps on all types of devices running different OS platforms. It provides a unified interface and components for a consistent map experience, eliminating the need for separate codebases for different app builds. This GitHub repository contains a detailed Getting Started guide to help developers learn and effectively implement the OMH Maps Client Library into their projects. 

For instance, the following screenshots showcase multiple devices with Android, both with GMS and Non-GMS. The same app works without changing a single line of code, supporting multiple map provider implementations (Google Maps and OpenStreetMap).

# Sample App
This repository includes a [maps-sample](/maps-sample) that demonstrates the functionality of the OMH Maps Client Library. By cloning the repo and executing the app, you can explore the various features offered by the library. However, if you prefer a step-by-step approach to learn the SDK from scratch, we recommend following the detailed Getting Started guide provided in this repository. The guide will walk you through the implementation process and help you integrate the OMH Maps Client Library into your projects effectively.
